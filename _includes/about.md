What I'm Up To These Days
-------------------------
I am working on physics related stuff at [Epic Games](https://epicgames.com).

I got my MS in Computer Science at [DigiPen](https://www.digipen.edu/) and my BS in Physics at [Taylor U](http://www.taylor.edu).

I've worked on Fortnite, Minecraft, and some indie projects at a kick-ass indie game studio called [Strange Loop Games](http://www.strangeloopgames.com/).

The stuff that gets me excited is collaborating on physics solvers, game design, neural networks, how brains work, and rock climbing.
