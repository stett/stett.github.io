Who I Am
--------
I'm Stett. I am a software engineer with a background in physics and a constant itch to produce art.

What I'm Doing
--------------
Working on my masters in computer science at a weird little school called [DigiPen](https://www.digipen.edu/), and writing code for an indie game studio called [Strange Loop Games](http://www.strangeloopgames.com/).

Predilections (Speculative)
---------------------------
This is a minimal list of things (or, I guess, the types of things) I like.

* Producing stuff (paintings! sculptures! programs!).

* Observing stuff (physics! visual art! music!).

Ideologies (Abstract)
---------------------
These are written in the first person because they are my own, and I do not think of them as objective or expect others to adopt them (although this would, of course, delight me :)).

* No person exists who is not worth my friendship.

* Pride is not a valid reason to give up on a problem (if I need help, then I should ask for it).

* It is not my place to negatively adjust another person's pride (if someone else needs help, it is at least as important that I protect their pride as it is that I provide the help they need).

* Value is essentially a subjective concept. Every person has a changing manifold of value assignments which will determine thier experience and behavior.

* Knowing something means having a sense that it belongs to a set of consistent, true propositions.

* All phenomena are physical ([ontological reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism)).

* The universe is spectacularly beautiful, whether or not it is reducible ([romanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism)).

* The greatest present mystery is that of [qualitative experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia).

* Qualia arises as a result of the integration of information over time [integrated information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory)

* Every individual has an informatic connection to many others, and so individual experience does not have hard boundaries (and perhaps should not be called "individual").

* Every action is a form of expression which reflects the active system. As an individual, every action I take can inform me about myself.

Goals (Concrete)
----------------
These are my current top personal goals. What I am doing with my life at any time ought to be determined by filtering these goals through the above ideologies.

* To publish and sell a videogame of my own design.

* To establish financial independence.

* To climb to the highest point in every state.

* To become a practiced lead climber.

* To become proficient at basic motorcycle maintenance.

* To find love (and to hold onto it).
