Who I Am
--------
I'm Stett. I am a software engineer with a background in physics an itch to make cool stuff, and a hankering for indie games.


What I'm Up To These Days
-------------------------
Working on my masters in computer science at a weird little school called [DigiPen](https://www.digipen.edu/), and writing code for an indie game studio called [Strange Loop Games](http://www.strangeloopgames.com/).

Oh! Hello! I didn't think you were gonna look at the source for my page. Ah well. Here are some the extremely intimate details of my life.


Predilections (Speculative)
---------------------------
This is an extremely minimal and general list of the types of things I like.

* Producing stuff (paintings! sculptures! programs!).

* Observing stuff (physics! visual art! music!).


Ideologies (Abstract)
---------------------

* No person exists who is not worth my friendship.

* Pride is not a valid reason to give up on a problem (if I need help, then I should ask for it).

* It is not my place to negatively adjust another person's pride (if someone else needs help, it is at least as important that I protect their pride as it is that I provide the help they need).

* Value is essentially a subjective concept. Every person has a changing manifold of value assignments which will determine thier experience and behavior.

* Knowing something means having a sense that it belongs to a set of consistent, true propositions.

* All phenomena are physical ([ontological reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism)).

* The universe is spectacularly beautiful, whether or not it is reducible ([romanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism)).

* The greatest present mystery is that of [qualitative experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia).

* Qualia arises as a result of the integration of information over time [integrated information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory)

* Every individual has an informatic connection to many others, and so individual experience does not have hard boundaries (and perhaps should not be called "individual").

* Every action is an expression of the state of the active system.


Goals (Concrete)
----------------

* To publish and sell a videogame which is both outrageously violent and intensely intelectual.

* To establish financial independence. ("Independence" defined: to not be in debt or worry about money for a period of 6 months)

* To have a studio space wherein I can do anything I want - painting, metalworking, coding, listening to loud music, etc.

* To hike/climb to the highest point in every state.

* To become a practiced lead climber.

* To become proficient at basic motorcycle maintenance.
