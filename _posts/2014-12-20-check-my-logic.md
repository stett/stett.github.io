I came across a logic problem the other day which required evaluation of some basic expressions to determine which were tautologies and which were not. It wasn't a difficult problem, but I wanted to check my answer. I couldn't easily find an online logical expression evaluator, and I'd been thinking about trying to build a simple logic syntax parser anyway, so I built [checkmylogic.com](http://checkmylogic.com/).
