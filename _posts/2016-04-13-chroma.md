Last semester me at 3 other incredibly handsome and intelligent DigiPen students worked together to design and code [a game called Chroma](http://games.digipen.edu/games/chroma) from scratch. The process was both harrowing and rewarding, and is something I'm sure many DigiPen veterans are familiar with.

I was responsible for writing our custom physics engine, memory and object management, creating the art assets, and designing some of the puzzle elements and special effects.

Here's a short list of things I've learned from working with Team MakiRoll.

1. Tight collaboration done well takes a ton of energy, but it's worth it. Presenting your idea or strategy for solving a problem to your peers to get feedback is valuable, especially when you're not confident about your approach.

2. Even if you choose a simple aesthetic to mitigate art production cost, it's *hard* to be both an artist and a programmer for a project with a deadline.

3. Designers are also developers - they must be invested in the project _at least_ as much as the coders if they're going to make a meaningful contribution.

4. It's awesome to work with smart people who push back with an open mind. If you're with people like that, be like that too. If you're not, push for consensus (gently) in order to bring out disagreements and reveal problems as early as possible.
