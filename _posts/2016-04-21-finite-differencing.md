Finite differencing is a common technique for approximating a calm, interactive water surface in games. This is a video of a small demo I made for a class on [PDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) at DigiPen.

The reflected environment in the water is just a skydome I grabbed from the awesome [HDRLabs sIBL Archive](http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html).
