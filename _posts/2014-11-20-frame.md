My own innocent little attempt at a simple Entity/Component/System engine. Frame follows a generic design, but is being built with a specific application in mind (Metabox).

Frame is _most definitely_ a work in progress.

I am roughly following test driven development principals, and using the [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) unit testing library.

The project is cross-platform and can be built using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/).

Source code and more details [here](https://github.com/stett/frame-0.4).
