![Hexican Standoff Concept]({{ site.url }}/assets/hexican-standoff.jpg)

It's a hexican standoff! Each cowboy points his gun at another, frozen with the intensity of the moment! As the hand of god, your goal is to kill all the pesky cowboys in one go by picking them up and dropping them, one or two at a time. A cowboy's gun always goes off when he falls or gets shot.

A challenging prototype for a western-themed board game. This prototype was developed rapidly as a mechanics experiment.

It'll be way more fun once winning means looking at a field of bleeding, dead cowboys instead of boring glowy hexes. The source (and the latest build) for the prototype can be found [here](https://github.com/stett/last-man-standin) on github.

Have some cowboys!
