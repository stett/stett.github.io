I spent this Christmas break creating this little simulation based on a paper I wrote for an undergraduate lab project a number of years ago. It is a discrete computation of the time evolution of a normalized waveform in an arbitrary potential field. The computation is done using FFT derivatives and Chebyshev polynomial expansion.

The program is structured using the Model/View/Controller paradigm, using SFML & SFGUI for graphics and window management, and googletest for unit testing. You can play around with the Win32 binary [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/QSim.exe), or checkout the source code [here](https://github.com/stett/qsim).
