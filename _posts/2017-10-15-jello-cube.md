The second installment in my progress on a ductile fracture physics engine. So far, it supports neither ductile nor fracturable materials, but elastodynamic deformation is a step in the right direction.

So far, it's pretty much a jello cube, created mostly following the FEM derivations by Erleben in Physics Based Animation. More technical updates to follow.
