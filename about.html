        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>I'm a software engineer with an artist's soul.</p>

        <h2>What I'm Doing</h2>
        <p>Working on my masters in computer science at a weird little school called (DigiPen)[https://www.digipen.edu/], and writing code for an indie game studio called (Strange Loop Games)[http://www.strangeloopgames.com/].</p>

        <h2>Ideologies (Abstract)</h2>
        <p>These are written in the first person because they are my own, and I do not think of them as objective or expect others to adopt them (although this would, of course, delight me :)).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No person exists who is not worth my friendship.</li>
            <li>Pride is not a valid reason to give up on a problem (if I need help, then I should ask for it).</li>
            <li>It is not my place to negatively adjust another person's pride (if someone else needs help, it is at least as important that I protect their pride as it is that I provide the help they need).</li>
            <li>Value is essentially a subjective concept. Every person has a changing manifold of value assignments which will determine thier experience and behavior.</li>
            <li>Knowing something means having a sense that it belongs to a set of consistent, true propositions.</li>
            <li>All phenomena are physical ([ontological reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism)).</li>
            <li>The universe is spectacularly beautiful, whether or not it is reducible ([romanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism)).</li>
            <li>The greatest present mystery is that of [qualitative experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia).</li>
            <li>Qualia arises as a result of the integration of information over time [integrated information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory)</li>
            <li>Every individual has an informatic connection to many others, and so individual experience does not have hard boundaries (and perhaps should not be called "individual").</li>
            <li>Every action is a form of expression which reflects the active system. As an individual, every action I take can inform me about myself.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Goals (Concrete)</h2>
        <p>These are my current top personal goals. What I am doing with my life at any time ought to be determined by filtering this goals through the above ideologies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To publish and sell a videogame of my own design.</li>
            <li>To establish financial independence.</li>
            <li>To climb to the highest point in every state.</li>
            <li>To become a practiced lead climber.</li>
            <li>To become proficient at basic motorcycle maintenance.</li>
            <li>To find love (and to hold onto it).</li>
        </ul>
