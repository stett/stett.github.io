On the side I've been reading [http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Quantum-Mechanics-Computer-Generated-Quantum-Mechanical/dp/B010WFGBTG/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1443156838&sr=8-8&keywords=visual+quantum+mechanics%5C](Visual Quantum Mechanics) by Bernd Thaller, trying to create a quantum particle simulation library of my own similar to the one presented in the book.

I completed a similar project during my undergrad, but I am much more code-competent than I was then and would like to re-make it now as a faster, more useful tool, mostly for my own education.
