For a time I have held the following ideal, and you may well call it unrealistic (I certainly do).

> No person exists who is not worth my friendship.

Forget about what gives a person worth, how this is measured, and exactly what it means to be a friend. This statement is the verbalization of a sentiment which, for some reason undiscovered, I have deeply felt for most of my life. And I feel it most strongly when the distance increases between another person and myself, even by a tiny sliver.

This unwieldy ideal mainly manifests as a deep feeling which makes itself obscenely present in my mind when either the distance between myself and another person has increased or the foggy ether of communication becomes impenetrably dense.
