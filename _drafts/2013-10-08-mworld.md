Inspired by a wonderful old Maxis game,  Marble Drop, this side project got to the point of having an editor, but not to that of having any gameplay.

The idea, though, was to have convoluted networks of interactive bits of marble-track -- a marble traveling through a switch might change the path of itself or a marble on another path. Each puzzle has a gravitational center, so it's a bit like a tiny puzzle planet :)

The player himself would play as a marble who could eat and regurgitate marbles when needed, in order to solve puzzles and travel from one marble planet to the next.
