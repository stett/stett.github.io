In the book [http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Quantum-Mechanics-Computer-Generated-Quantum-Mechanical/dp/B010WFGBTG/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1443156838&sr=8-8&keywords=visual+quantum+mechanics%5C](Visual Quantum Mechanics) by Bernd Thaller, a nice, simple method is outlined for producing an RBG color based on a complex number. This is useful for any kind of simulation which uses complex math to transform grids of points.

Positional data is easily encoded visually, but complex phase (though it's meaning is a bit harder to discern) can also be informative, if only for debugging.
